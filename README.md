*"Prepare for trouble, and make it double!"*

A simple, mobile-friendly web app for assigning roles and creating balanced teams, inspired by Team Rocket from Pokémon.

## Features
- Assign unique codes to trainers (numeric or alphabetic)
- Divide trainers into squads/teams fairly
- Skip or lock specific trainers for custom team setups
- Clean, responsive UI (Bootstrap-inspired, but custom styled)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser—no build or server required.

## But why?
This project is themed after Team Rocket, aiming to make group assignments fun and efficient for tournaments, raids, or any team-based activity.
